# hello-world

I am a statistician / data wrangler working at Statistics Canada, the national statistical agency of Canada.

This is my first repository. I am creating this to learn about github and source control programs in general.

I am doing a second test of editing the read me and commiting edits on an edit branch and then merging these back into the master branch.
